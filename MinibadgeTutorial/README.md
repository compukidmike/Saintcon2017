# Minibadge Tutorial
This year at Saintcon, the badge has places for minibadges to be added to it. These are the files that go along with my "village talk" on PCB design 101. 

This talk is meant to be a quick and dirty tutorial on making simple PCBs in eagle. I skip over a lot of things like bypass capacitors, because these minibadges aren't meant to be mass-produced, consumer ready parts. They're just for fun at a conference. If they mostly work, that's good enough.
